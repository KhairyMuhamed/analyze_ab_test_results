# analyze_ab_test_results
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:

- Implement the new webpage,
- Keep the old webpage, or
- Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
