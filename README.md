# analyze_ab_test_results
working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website using:
▪ Probability.
▪ A/b test (hypotheses testing). 
▪ Regression.
- My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should:
▪ Implement the new webpage.
▪ Keep the old webpage.
▪ Perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
